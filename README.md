A course based project on Railway Reservation System using C++ Programming concepts
INTRODUCTION

The railway reservation system is a critical component of the railway industry that provides convenient and efficient ticket booking services to travelers. With the increasing demand for railway transportation, the need for an effective and efficient reservation system has become imperative. The traditional manual booking systems are time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to dissatisfaction among travelers. With the advent of technology, computerized railway reservation systems have emerged as a solution to these problems.

A railway reservation system based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ provides a user-friendly interface for booking train tickets, viewing available trains, and managing reservations. The system is designed to incorporate OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure a modular and scalable solution. The implementation uses classes to represent objects such as trains, seats, and passengers, and implements various functions to perform actions such as booking, cancelling, and displaying reservations.

The system also implements data validation and mechanisms to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data. The system stores and retrieves data from a database or file to keep track of reservations and availability of seats. It also provides security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure the confidentiality of user data. The system is designed to handle large amounts of data and ensure efficient ticket booking, with additional features such as ticket cancellation, seat selection, and waiting list management.

The railway reservation system offers several benefits over traditional manual systems. It provides a fast and convenient booking process, eliminates errors, and reduces wait times. The system provides real-time information about train schedules and seat availability, making it easier for travelers to plan their journeys. It also provides reports and analytics to track reservation and ticket sales data, and monitor system usage. The system is designed to be secure and reliable, providing peace of mind to travellers. 
OBJECTIVES


1.	Here are some objectives that the railway reservation system project could aim to achieve:

2.	Design a user-friendly interface: The system should provide an easy-to-use interface for users to book train tickets, view available trains, and manage reservations.

3.	Implement OOP principles: The system should be designed and implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure a modular and scalable solution.

4.	Represent objects as classes: The system should use classes to represent objects such as trains, seats, and passengers, and implement functions to perform actions such as booking, cancelling, and displaying reservations.

5.	Validate data: The system should implement data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data.

6.	Store and retrieve data: The system should store and retrieve data from a database or file to keep track of reservations and availability of seats.

7.	Provide security: The system should implement security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure the confidentiality of user data.

8.	Ensure efficient ticket booking: The system should be designed to ensure efficient ticket booking and manage large amounts of data effectively.

9.	Offer additional features: The system should offer additional features such as ticket cancellation, seat selection, and waiting list management to provide a comprehensive solution . 
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

•	User management: The system should allow users to register and log in to the system, and provide the ability to manage their personal information and reservations.

•	Train information: The system should provide information about available trains, including departure and arrival times, routes, and seating arrangements.

•	Reservation management: The system should allow users to make, view, and modify their reservations, and provide the ability to cancel tickets if necessary.

•	Payment processing: The system should provide a secure and efficient mechanism for processing payments for ticket bookings.

•	Ticket generation: The system should generate and provide electronic tickets to users after successful payment

Backend:

We used the files to store the data.
CONCLUSION


The Railway Reservation System project using OOP in C++ is a computerized system designed to automate the train ticket booking process. The project uses OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide a user-friendly interface for booking train tickets, checking seat availability, cancelling tickets, and more. Classes are used to define the data and behavior of different entities in the system, while objects represent real-world entities and contain specific data. Inheritance allows common attributes and behaviors to be inherited from parent classes to child classes, while polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method call differently. Overall, the railway reservation system project demonstrates the effectiveness of OOP in creating efficient and manageable systems
